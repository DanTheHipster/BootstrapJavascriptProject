# BootstrapJavascriptProject

I chose to do a very basic emulation of the cracker barrel website. I realized a little too late that it was more than i could handle given that im behind already and bootstrap feels a little weird to use. 

I included in this project the modal, a carousel, and the card type for presentation.

the cards are represented with the different promotional items such as the campfire chicken, shrimp, and beef. This also includes the Smores latte.

I used the modal for a promotional pop up. However I could get neither that to center or the Footer to thin out and not block a ton of the screen.
Nothing I could find would help me out with the footer and that has been a persistent issue so if you could give me a few pointers on that I would be really appreciative.

I used the Carousel to create a slide of some menu items that were included in the table.
 I also used some highlights on the table and border lines to make them look more separated.

As for the functions side of things, I found some examples for a pegs number generator. The pegs are their version of points and I figured like a random reward of points for specific items would be an incentive to buy.
I did an alert message for welcoming returning customers to the site once they have logged in.
I used an example of a cart Total function to check cart items and return the total price.

I used an email validation function that was shown in one of the emails and finally a countdown for promotional releases so that customers could follow in real time and build hype for the releases.
